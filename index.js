/* Variable = A container that stores a value, this value can change later on, depending on the conditions or on information passed to the program 
  Behaves as if it were the value it contains
*/

// The two principal steps to create a variable are:
// 1. declaration  let x;
// 2. assignment   x = 100;

// Every variable name needs to be unique.
// If we declare two variables with the same name, the console output will be an error.

let x;
x = 100;

console.log(x);

// to do both declaration and assignment at the same time, it goes something like this

let y = 443;

console.log(y);
