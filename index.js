// Use console.log to print whataver you want in the console

console.log(`hello`);
console.log(`I like videogames`);

/* Variable = A container that stores a value, this value can change later on, depending on the conditions or on information passed to the program
  Behaves as if it were the value it contains
*/

// The two principal steps to create a variable are:
// 1. declaration  let x;
// 2. assignment   x = 100;

// Every variable name needs to be unique.
// If we declare two variables with the same name, the console output will be an error.

let x;
x = 100;
console.log(x);

// to do both declaration and assignment at the same time, it goes something like this

let y = 443;
console.log(y);

// In the console.log we can insert declared variables with the "${}" command

let price = `5.50â‚¬`;
console.log(`The price is ${price}`);

let age = `18`;
console.log(`I am ${age} years old`);

let titles = `4`;
console.log(`Max is a ${titles} time world champion`)


// Strings, a series of characters.

let firstName = 'Talena';
// Typeof is a keyword that can show what type of variable your declaring
console.log(typeof firstName);
//In the console the output will be "string" indicating that the variable firstName is a string
// Now lets print that variable
console.log(firstName);
// Now with a placeholder
console.log(`My name is ${firstName}`);

let favoriteFood = 'Lasagna';
console.log(`My favorite food is ${favoriteFood}`);

let email = 'talenabarbosa7@gmail.com';
console.log(`My email is ${email}`);

// Its important to remember that strings can contain numbers, like shown above, but they cant be used for math. They have a different behavior for numbers


// Booleans, are either true or false, typically used as flags in your program

let online = false;
// lets display the type of the variable
console.log(typeof online); // The output is a boolean
console.log(`Is talena online: ${online}`); // The output is false

// Another example could be: is something for sale or not?

let sale = true;
console.log(`is that car for sale: ${sale}`);

let isStudent = true;
console.log(`is he intelligent: ${isStudent}`);

// Usually booleans aare not used as a direct output like we're doing here. They're used with if statements to check on something.
