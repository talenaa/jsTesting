// Use console.log to print whataver you want in the console

/* Variable = A container that stores a value, this value can change later on, depending on the conditions or on information passed to the program
  Behaves as if it were the value it contains
*/

// The two principal steps to create a variable are:
// 1. declaration  let x;
// 2. assignment   x = 100;

// Every variable name needs to be unique.
// If we declare two variables with the same name, the console output will be an error.

let x;
x = 100;
console.log(x);

// to do both declaration and assignment at the same time, it goes something like this

let y = 443;
console.log(y);

// In the console.log we can insert declared variables with the "${}" command

let price = `5.50€`;
console.log(`The price is ${price}`);

let age = `18`;
console.log(`I am ${age} years old`);

let titles = `4`;
console.log(`Max is a ${titles} time world champion`)

// Strings, a series of characters.

let firstName = 'Talena';
// Typeof is a keyword that can show what type of variable your declaring
console.log(typeof firstName);
//In the console the output will be "string" indicating that the variable firstName is a string
// Now lets print that variable
console.log(firstName);
// Now with a placeholder
console.log(`My name is ${firstName}`);

let favoriteFood = 'Lasagna';
console.log(`My favorite food is ${favoriteFood}`);

let email = 'talenabarbosa7@gmail.com';
console.log(`My email is ${email}`);

// Its important to remember that strings can contain numbers, like shown above, but they cant be used for math. They have a different behavior for numbers
